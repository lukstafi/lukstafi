* Prior to 2014, I contributed to [Toss: General Game Playing and Hybrid Modelling](https://toss.sourceforge.net).
* I worked on my [Functional Programming lectures](https://ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lukstafi/FPcourse) (in OCaml) between February 2012 and March 2013. Currently I'm [migrating the lectures into a book format](https://lukstafi.github.io/curious-ocaml/old_lectures_as_book.html), and then I'll [rewrite them as a book for OCaml 5](https://lukstafi.github.io/curious-ocaml/new_book.html).
* In 2015, I defended my PhD thesis on [inferring the properties of programs](http://ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lukstafi/pmwiki/uploads/Infer/invargent-simple-slides.pdf). I finished [the code in March 2015](https://github.com/lukstafi/invargent).
* Between 2015-2021 I worked at Google, on knowledge representation and semantic parsing (in C++), then briefly on deep reinforcement learning (Python/[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)).
* After using Emacs and [TeXmacs](https://texmacs.org) for two decades, in 2022 I made a definite switch to Visual Studio Code. I wrote [Navi Parens](https://github.com/lukstafi/navi-parens) with what I was missing from Emacs, and I'm working on [vsc-markmacs](https://github.com/lukstafi/vsc-markmacs) to reproduce my TeXmacs use cases.
* My main project is [OCANNL](https://github.com/lukstafi/ocannl), a from-scratch deep learning framework fully in OCaml.
