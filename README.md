* Prior to 2014, I contributed to [Toss: General Game Playing and Hybrid Modelling](https://toss.sourceforge.net).
* I worked on my [Functional Programming lectures](https://ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lukstafi/FPcourse) between February 2012 and March 2013. Check out the lecture slides and the exercises. Focuses on [OCaml](https://ocaml.org), my favorite programming language.
* In 2015, I defended my PhD thesis on [inferring the properties of programs](http://ii.uni.wroc.pl/~lukstafi/pmwiki/uploads/Infer/invargent-simple-slides.pdf). I wrote the code March 2013 to March 2015; but it took lots of exploration before that.
* Between 2015-2021 I worked at Google, on knowledge representation and semantic parsing (in C++), then briefly on deep reinforcement learning (Python/JAX). [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is my favorite ML framework.
* After using Emacs for two decades, this year (2022) I made a definite switch to Visual Studio Code. My favorite scientific editor is [TeXmacs](https://texmacs.org).
